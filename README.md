# Overview

`monasca-api` is a RESTful API server that is designed with a layered architecture [layered architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture).

## Build

Requires monasca-common from https://github.com/stackforge/monasca-common. Download and do mvn install.

```
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

```
java -jar target/monasca-api.jar server config-file.yml
```

## Design Overview

### Architectural layers

Requests flow through the following architectural layers from top to bottom:

* Resource
  * Serves as the entrypoint into the service. 
  * Responsible for handling web service requests, and performing structural request validation.
* Application
  * Responsible for providing application level implementations for specific use cases.
* Domain
  * Contains the technology agnostic core domain model and domain service definitions.
  * Responsible for upholding invariants and defining state transitions.
* Infrastructure
  * Contains technology specific implementations of domain services.
  
## Documentation

* API Specification: [/docs/monasca-api-spec.md](/docs/monasca-api-spec.md).


python monasca api implementation
=================================

To install the python api implementation, git clone the source and run the
following command::

    sudo python setup.py install

If it installs successfully, you will need to make changes to the following
two files to reflect your system settings, especially where kafka server is
located::

    /etc/monasca/monasca.ini
    /etc/monasca/monasca.conf

Once the configurations are modified to match your environment, you can start
up the server by following the following instructions.

To start the server, run the following command:

    Running the server in foreground mode
    gunicorn -k eventlet --worker-connections=2000 --backlog=1000
             --paste /etc/monasca/monasca.ini

    Running the server as daemons
    gunicorn -k eventlet --worker-connections=2000 --backlog=1000
             --paste /etc/monasca/monasca.ini -D

To check if the code follows python coding style, run the following command
from the root directory of this project

    tox -e pep8
    
To run all the unit test cases, run the following command from the root
directory of this project

    tox -e py27   (or -e py26, -e py33)
