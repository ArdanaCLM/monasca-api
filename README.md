# Overview

`mon-api` is a RESTful API server that is designed with a layered architecture [layered architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture).

## Build

Requires mon-common from https://github.com/hpcloud-mon/mon-common. Download and do mvn install from within the java directory.

```
cd java
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

```
java -jar target/mon-api.jar server config-file.yml
```

## Design Overview

### Architectural layers

Requests flow through the following architectural layers from top to bottom:

* Resource
  * Serves as the entrypoint into the service. 
  * Responsible for handling web service requests, and performing structural request validation.
* Application
  * Responsible for providing application level implementations for specific use cases.
* Domain
  * Contains the technology agnostic core domain model and domain service definitions.
  * Responsible for upholding invariants and defining state transitions.
* Infrastructure
  * Contains technology specific implementations of domain services.
  
## Documentation

There are several forms of documentation for the Monitoring API.

* Overview: [/docs/mon-api-overview.md](/docs/mon-api-overview.md). This describes some of the concepts in the Monitoring API.

* API Specification: [/docs/mon-api-spec.md](/docs/mon-api-spec.md). This is the RESTful API specification.

* swagger-ui: When running mon-api the API docs along with the API test interface can be accessed at, [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/). Note: the trailing "/" is necessary for the Swagger UI to work properly. Currently, this is the best way to review the specification.
